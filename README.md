The "Advance-Keylogger" project was developed using Python to monitor and analyze keystrokes on computers. It is designed for supervising activities on company-provided systems to ensure compliance and protect sensitive data. The keylogger helps monitor employee interactions with company services, detect unauthorized access, and prevent data trespassing. By capturing user activity, it aims to identify potential data leaks and stop critical information from being sold to competitors. This tool serves as an essential security measure for companies to protect their data integrity and ensure that their digital resources are used responsibly and securely.
